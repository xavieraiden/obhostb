Subject: Analysis Log Conclusion - Enigmatic Wreck Exploration 
Date: ██/██/44█
Location: ██.7238°N ██.2662°E 
Objective: Analyse and Decipher the Enigmatic Wreck 
Research Team Members: █████ ██████, ██████ ██████, ██████ ██████†, ██████ ██████†, ██████ ██████†, ██████ ██████†, ██████ ██████†. 

Summary:
- Day 1: The research team commenced analysis by documenting and cataloguing retrieved artefacts. Focus on historical, cultural, and artistic significance.
- Day 2: Emphasis on deciphering symbols and inscriptions found on artefacts and within the wreck. Comparative studies and scientific analysis conducted.

Conclusion: Wreck unlikely intended for exploration or trade. Suggests alternative, potentially military, purpose. Advanced technology and intricate design indicative of a highly sophisticated civilization.

[[Captain's Log]] Summary:
- Day 1: Encountered colossal metallic structure. Commenced meticulous examination of artefacts and observed stylistic patterns and craftsmanship techniques.
- Day 2: Continued deciphering inscriptions and symbols. Conducted scientific analysis of materials and manufacturing techniques.
- Day 3: Explored various rooms and compartments within the vessel. Encountered water damage and evidence of past habitation.

[[Wreck Exploration Log]] Summary:
- Day 1: Discovered massive metallic structure. Observed decay and corrosion. Encountered unfamiliar machinery and perplexing panels.
- Day 2: Explored living quarters and central chamber with intricate components. Noted presence of water and structural deterioration.
- Day 3: Explored storage compartments with artefacts. Discovered enigmatic chamber with interconnected wires.

[[Captain's Log]] Briefing:
- Uncovered colossal metallic structure with enigmatic symbols and inscriptions.
- Explored intricate machinery and mechanisms within the vessel.
- Encountered decay, corrosion, and evidence of past habitation.
- Notable artefacts discovered, but purpose and cultural significance remain elusive.
- Power system and suspected capabilities within the vessel puzzle researchers.
- Craft's purpose, origin, and the civilization responsible for its creation remain enigmatic.
- Potential Craft Capabilities (speculative):
- High-speed potential based on sleek and streamlined shape.
- Potential for covert operations due to features minimizing surveillance detection.
- Potential submersible capabilities, extent unknown.
- Potential presence of undisclosed capabilities, yet to be determined.

Confirmed Information:
- Length: 117.5 meters
- Beam: 10.7 meters
- Displacement: Between 4,400 and 8,000 tons (dependent on floatation level)

Additional Notes:
- Lack of visible sails or deck.
- Craft's design and materials align with the enigmatic metal found within the kingdom.
- Craft's purpose, actual capabilities, and origin require further exploration and analysis.

Conclusion:
Research team tragically lost in a catastrophic explosion within the wreck. Witnesses to the explosion have also become casualties Vessel completely destroyed, along with artefacts, machinery, and inscriptions. Cause of explosion remains unknown. Further analysis and research rendered impossible. Enigmatic wreck and its secrets now lost forever. Recommendations: Cessation of research due to the vessel's destruction. Acknowledgment of the sacrifice made by fallen colleagues. Reminder of the risks involved in pursuing knowledge of ancient mysteries. 

_**Status: Case closed. Further exploration and analysis deemed unfeasible.**_
