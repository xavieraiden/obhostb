# What are they?
Railguns are in concept quite simple, you have 2 conductive rails as well as a conductive projectile which bridges those two rails. Due to the [Lorentz Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force) when applying a large current down the rails, you end up with a very large force that accelerates the projectile.

# What's the difference?
Railguns are quite similar to their cousin the [Coilgun](Coilguns) but where railguns use the Lorentz force to propel their projectile, [[Coilguns]] use a series of [electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet) which they switch on and off.

# What are the advantages?
- Railguns are quite simple, and thus easy to build. 
- They also have a very high muzzle velocity, prototype military railguns can achieve muzzle velocities in excess of 2km/s. 
- They are incredibly accurate and have a very flat ballistic arc, making it easy to hit this significantly farther than a conventional gun/cannon. 
- They would also be more useful in a situation where you may not want to be shooting around 6 inch naval cannons (they are a bit loud) as Railguns have less muzzle flash, and make less sound, of course you will still get the shockwave from the projectile. 
- They are incredibly scalable, you could have a handheld railgun or a massive naval one!

# What are the disadvantages?
- Massive energy requirements (Who knew that firing a metal slug at 2km/s was power hungry?)
- Rail erosion: This is likely the single largest issue that railguns face if they were to ever be deployed. When firing, the incredibly high current flowing through the rails vaporises some of the rail, and thus you need to replace the rails very often.
- Complexity: While railguns are in theory simple to build, in actuality they are not. Railguns require incredibly tight tolerances so as to not fail spectacularly and to work with maximum efficiency.
- Electromagnetic Interference: When firing, a massive amount of [Electromagnetic Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) as well as an incredibly large magnetic field could interfere with nearby electronics. 


# Nonstandard Railguns

### Sequential Armature Single Cycle Railguns (SASCRs)
A SASCR is a hypothetical Railgun that can fire multiple projectiles in a single cycle. Think of it like a burst firing Railgun. This would not be achievable if the railgun is using Capacitors as they discharge too quickly, but if the railgun uses [Supercapacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor) or Batteries theoretically you could pass multiple armatures through the rails as it discharges, leading to a sort of burst effect. A SASCR is different to a MASCR is that a SASCR feeds the armatures in one after the other, whereas a MASCR would have them all placed in the rails at specific intervals.
(You can technically achieve the same effect by having multiple standard capacitors that discharge one after the other, but It's not really the same thing)

### Multiple Armature Single Cycle Railguns (MASCRs)
As discussed above, a MASCR works differently to a SASCR in that it would operate more like conventional Duplex round, where you simply have multiple armatures in the rails at the same time. This would be achievable using standard capacitor railguns as it would act on all armatures at once.

# The Nuclear Option...
Of course, there has always been the idea to use a Railgun to fire an armature containing a nuclear warhead at a target. Because why not?
