# What are they?

Shaped Charges are a type of warhead that creates a hypersonic jet of metal particles through a principle called [Explosive Lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_lens). They generally use a metal liner, often made of copper, that is vaporized (not melted!) and propelled by the shockwaves of the explosive filler. This is in contrast to [Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFPs)](EFPs) which propel a metal slug.

# What's the difference?

Shaped Charges and [[EFPs]] operate differently but aim to achieve the same end goal: to destroy or incapacitate the target they are aimed at.
### Shaped Charges

Shaped Charges operate through the principle of [Explosive Lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_lens). The shockwaves from the explosive filler are manipulated in such a way that they vaporize and propel an inverted cone made from a metal liner, usually copper. This creates a hypersonic jet of metal particles that can penetrate armour or other materials. Though Shaped Charges are no longer as effective against tanks due to the advent of [composite armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_armour), Shaped charges are still incredibly effective against lighter vehicles and buildings.

# Nonstandard Shaped Charges
This category does not necessarily refer to rare or uncommon Shaped Charges, but rather any Shaped Charge that is nonstandard. This is a non exhaustive list

### Linear Shaped Charges (LSC)
Linear shaped charges are similar to a normal shaped charge, but they have one key difference. They are ***Wide***. LSCs are generally used for [military breaching purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_breaching), cutting metal or demolition purposes. Instead of creating a single spear like jet of plasma, it generates more of a blade shape to cut something in half, rather than punch a hole in it.

### Tandem Shaped Charges (TSC)
Similar to [Tandem EFPs](EFPs#Tandem%20EFPs), TSCs use two warheads, A Pre and Post warhead. The Pre-Warhead is used to defeat any [reactive armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour) that may be present. Then, the Post-Warhead penetrates the armour of the target and deals a significant amount of damage in the form of the plasma jet, spall as well as any of the leftover shockwave from the initiating explosion.

### [Misznay-Schardin (MS) Charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misznayâ€“Schardin_effect)
MS Charges are Interesting in that they first seem very similar to [[EFPs]] but are actually quite different. An MS charge is an explosive charge which has a large mas blocking one of the direction the shockwave would normally go, causing the shockwave to reflect off of whatever material is used (Any Heavy or Fixed Mass) effectively turning it into a "Shockwave Cannon". This *Can* be used to propel a large metal plate to kill armour, but in modern day they are most often used in explosive mines like the [M18 Claymore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore_mine)where one might one to propagate the blast wave in only one direction.
This is speculation as I've never seen it directly stated but I would suspect this effect is used in regular shaped charges to maximise the energy usage from the explosives.

No images demonstrating this effect are available, sorry :(


# The Nuclear Option...
Nuclear Driven Shaped Charges (NDSCs) also known as the "[Casaba Howitzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casaba-Howitzer)". Unlike [NDEFPs](EFPs#The%20Nuclear%20Option) NDSCs do not use Explosively Formed Penetrators, they do however share a similarity in that they both use small nuclear bombs to drive them. Speculative NDSCs could have penetrator velocities in the hundreds if not thousands of km/s
### Not to be confused with the [Casaba Howitzer](Shaped%20Charges#The%20Nuclear%20Option)
