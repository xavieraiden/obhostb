# What are they?
Coilguns use a series of electromagnets which they switch on and off using complex electronics to propel a [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetic) projectile to very high speeds.

# What's the difference?
Coilguns are quite similar to their cousin the [Railgun](Railguns). While Railguns use the [Lorentz force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force) to propel a conductive projectile, Coilguns instead use a series of electromagnets which are switched on and off in a specific pattern to pull and or push the [ferromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetic) projectile along.

# What are the advantages?
- No Explosive Propellant: No explosive propellant is stored and therefore ammunition cookoffs are not a problem unless the munitions themselves do (E.g. If the projectiles have warheads). [[Railguns]] have this problem sometimes depending on how they work. Some [[railguns]] use explosives to get the projectile going down the barrel (The projectile will just weld itself in place if it is not moving when it enters the rails). Though some [[Railguns]] use Coilguns or other [Linear motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_motor) to push the projectile into the rails.
- High Velocity: Theoretically Coilguns can have a higher muzzle velocity than [[Railguns]] due to the fact that the projectile in a Coilgun (ideally) does not make contact with anything, and therefore there is no friction involved.
- High Accuracy: Like the [Railgun](Railguns) Coilguns shoot incredibly fast, meaning it is easier to hit things at long ranges due to a very flat trajectory.
- Lower Wear and Tear: Unlike [[Railguns]], Coilguns don't have issues with [Rail Erosion](Railguns#What%20are%20the%20disadvantages?) or even barrel friction, so they have much longer barrel lives than railguns, or even conventional guns.
- Scalability: Coilguns, like [[Railguns]], are incredibly easy to scale up and down.
- Stealth: Again, even more so than [[Railguns]], Coilguns are even quieter and while [[Railguns]] still have some muzzle flash due to Rail Erosion, Coilguns have no muzzle flash assuming nothing goes wrong.

# What are the disadvantages?
- High Energy Requirements: As with [[Railguns]], Coilguns have high energy requirements, though not as much sheer power is needed as [[Railguns]].
- Complexity: While [[Railguns]] are actually quite simple, Coilguns are significantly more complicated.  
- Electromagnetic Interference: Similar to [[Railguns]], Coilguns generate an incredibly intense magnetic field to propel their projectile which could interfere with electronics.

# Nonstandard Coilguns

### Sequential Armature Single Cycle Coinguns (SASCCs)
As with [SASCRs](Railguns#Sequential%20Armature%20Single%20Cycle%20Railguns%20(SASCRs)), SASCCs require either multiple capacitors per coil, [Supercapacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor) or a Battery. As like [SASCRs](Railguns#Sequential%20Armature%20Single%20Cycle%20Railguns%20(SASCRs)) this is achieve by passing multiple armatures through the Coilgun per charge cycle.

### Superconducting Coilguns
A Superconducting Coilgun operates the exact same way as a normal one, or it could even be a SASCC. But instead of regular [Electromagnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet), [Superconducting Magnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnet) are used, vastly increasing the efficiency of such a system.

### Specialised Coil Arrangements
Most Coilguns either have the  [Electromagnet's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnet) coil position either around the barrel of the Coilgun, or to the sides of the Coilgun. Specialised Coil Arrangements could be use to do things like impart spin on the projectile, which would lead to increased ballistic stability (assuming you aren't using fin stabilised ammunition that is).

# The Nuclear Option...
Of course, there has always been the idea to use a Coilgun to fire an armature containing a nuclear warhead at a target. Because why not?
