# What are they?
EFPs Or Explosively Formed Penetrators are a type of warhead that propel a small metal (usually copper as far as I'm aware, though other metals may have more desirable properties) slug. As opposed to a [Shaped Charge](Shaped%20Charges) which creates a hypersonic jet of metal particles.
[Wiki Page on EFPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator)

# What's the difference?
An EFP operates differently to a [Shaped charge](Shaped%20Charges.md), though with the same end goal of killing whatever it's pointed at.
### EFPs
While shaped charges use [Explosive Lensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_lens) to create their projectile, EFPs take a more direct approach in that they use the explosive force to just shoot the metal plate like a gun would all while in the process deforming the metal plate into a slug.

# Nonstandard EFPs
This category does not necessarily refer to rare or uncommon EFPs, but rather any EFP that is nonstandard. This is a non exhaustive list
### Multiple EFPs (MEFPs)
Multiple EFPs (Hereby referred to as MEFPs) are any EFP that results in more than one projectile or slug as a result of their operation. This can be done through having a main slug as well as a fragmentation pattern (As seen in example D) Another way to do this though is to simply have the metal plate used as a projectile have a pattern of concave circles, which acts as a fragmentation pattern, while simultaneously each individual fragment is deformed into a slug. (Seen in example C) The general purpose of these would be to: A. Engage multiple targets simultaneously. Or B. Engage an Armoured Vehicle along with any Unarmoured vehicles or dismounted infantry nearby.

Alternatively, you could pack several smaller standalone EFPs into a single housing to produce a similar effect.

The difference between an EFP and a fragmentation shell though, is the requirement that there be at least 1 projectile that was deformed into a slug like shape. Otherwise you just have a High Explosive Fragmentation Warhead, which while effective against infantry or unarmoured vehicles will do next to nothing against armour.

### Tandem EFPs
Tandem EFPs, similar to [Tandem Shaped Charges](Shaped%20Charges#Tandem%20Shaped%20Charges) are two staged munitions designed to defeat [reactive armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_armour). The first stage or "Prepositive Charge" is designed to detonate any reactive armour, then the second "Postpositive Charge" is the projectile that actually has an effect on target.

RPUF in this image referring to a material called Rigid polyurethane foam. Likely used in this 
example to keep the Prepositive charge from destroying the Postpositive Charge.

### Variable Geometry EFPs
These EFPs have adjustable liners that can be changed in shape before firing. This allows for the customization of the penetrator's shape and, consequently, its effects on the target.

### Enhanced Material Liners
Most EFPs use copper as a liner, but other materials can be used. For example, Depleted Uranium could be used as a liner for it's [pyrophoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophoricity) properties. This would allow the Penetrator to self sharpen and have an incendiary action upon penetration. 

### EFPs with Secondary Payloads
These EFPs contain a secondary payload, such as chemical, biological, or even additional explosive materials.

An example of this would be an EFP which launches it's penetrator, then afterwards launches a second projectile consisting of a blast fragmentation warhead, through the hole the first penetrator made. This would enhance lethality by not only doing damage through the penetrator itself, but through a secondary explosion, which could injure or kill crew members in the vehicle more effectively.



# The Nuclear Option...
Theoretically, instead of using conventional high explosives, you could use a small nuclear bomb to propel and form the projectile. A nuclear-driven MEFP (NDMEFP) was apparently proposed by a member of the [JASON group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASON_(advisory_group) "JASON (advisory group)") in 1966 for terminal [ballistic missile defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_defense "Ballistic missile defense").

Nuclear Driven EFPs (NDEFPs) would likely be more useful in space combat though, as the large distances involved could lead classical EFPs to have too slow of a penetrator velocity to be effective at such long distances. Even 2km/s is too slow at those distances. Speculative NDEFPs could have penetrator velocities in the hundreds if not thousands of km/s
### Not to be confused with the [Casaba Howitzer](Shaped%20Charges#The%20Nuclear%20Option)
The [Casaba Howitzer](Shaped%20Charges#The%20Nuclear%20Option) is an entirely different concept, though similar. Instead of an Nuclear Driven EFP, the Casaba Howitzer is a Nuclear Driven [Shaped Charge](Shaped%20Charges.md).
