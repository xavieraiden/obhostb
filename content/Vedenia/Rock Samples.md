Research Log - Enigmatic Metal Discovery Location: ██.67717°N ███.47569°W Date: ██/██/43█ Objective: Study and Understand the Properties of the Enigmatic Metal Research Team Members: ████████ ████████, ██████ ████████, ████████████, ████████ ███████, ███████████ ██████, ██████ █████████, ████████ █████████. Date: ██/██/43█ A significant discovery unfolded within our research team. An unidentified member stumbled upon a discoloured layer of rock emitting a faint, non-visible light with an energy level surpassing that of visible light. The samples of this peculiar rock were swiftly transported to a secure facility for extensive study. 

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Upon closer analysis, it was determined that the emitted light possessed an energy exceeding 10,000 times that of standard visible light. The intriguing phenomenon of the diminishing light remained unexplained, adding to the mystery surrounding this enigmatic metal. 

Date: ██/██/43█
Further analysis revealed that the discoloured layer was composed of an unidentified metal with a density approximately half that of iron. This lightweight and distinct metal intrigued the research team, raising questions about its origin and potential applications.

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Alarming observations were made regarding the individuals closely working with the specimens. They exhibited a high incidence of cellular malfunction and damage, the cause of which remains unknown and subject to ongoing investigation.

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Subsequent experimentation unveiled a violent reaction between the metal and water, resulting in eruptions of flames and occasional explosive reactions. This discovery emphasized the potential dangers and unique nature of the metal. 

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Observations conducted by specialized mages indicated a significant increase in the basicity of water when exposed to the metal, suggesting a shift towards a higher pH value. The underlying mechanisms and implications of this transformation are being investigated. 

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Re-examination of various locations yielded astonishing results, with the discoloured metal discovered in numerous sites beyond the initial survey area. Its widespread presence hints at a fundamental aspect of the region's geological history, potentially spanning a significant period. 

Date: ██/██/43█ 
Historical records provided glimpses of similar metal occurrences, though the scale and magnitude of the current discovery far surpass previous findings. This revelation has ignited renewed interest among researchers and historians, driving them to unravel the secrets concealed within the kingdom's geological tapestry.   

- Note: The origin, formation, and purpose of this enigmatic metal remain subjects of ongoing research. Its unique properties and widespread distribution present intriguing possibilities for further exploration and investigation.
