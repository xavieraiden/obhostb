# First, a Disclaimer.
Some of the stuff here might be hard to read, or bring up stuff that you might have experienced in the past.

# TLDR
I'm Xavier, an Autistic 17 year old with a lot of problems. This website and all this stuff is a way of expressing myself.

## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Xavier. You'll see me online as `xavieraiden`, `ParoXysm` or simply `Xavier`. I'm 17 as of 2023 and a lot of stuff is going on in my life that won't be discussed here. I'm from Australia and you can probably tell I'm not amazing at punctuation or writing sentences.

## Medical Stuff
I have a lot of things going on medically wise, A lot of which effect my sleep in detrimental ways. There are quite a few things wrong with me medically, stuff like: [Hasimoto's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) Suspected [Kleine Levin Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleineâ€“Levin_syndrome), Suspected [Non 24 Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/non-24-sleep-wake-disorder), Suspected [Hypersomnia](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/hypersomnia) And probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. On the other side of things I'm also diagnosed with:
- [Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum)
- [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) (Just the Attention Deficit part though)
- [Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety)
- [Depression](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mental_illness))

# The stuff below kind of sucks, only read it if you want to know more about how I became who I am today.

## My history with self esteem
I lived with someone who I now realize was incredibly emotionally abusive for a long time. They did so many little things to degrade me, but the thing I remember the most is how angry they would get at me if I walked in front of them. They were also incredibly emotionally manipulative to the other people we lived with. So from a very young age it was instilled in me that I was less than other people, and should therefore always walk behind them, along with many other things. As expected this has caused a lot of damage and led to my self esteem being directly tied to how useful I am to other people.

## My history with the Education system
My history with the School system has not been good to say the least. Over the last year, I've only spent around 2 months actually enrolled in a school, and even then I'm only able to attend every other week (optimistically). I've always rationally understood that I am a smart person, but when you spend almost 3 years in a system that is constantly telling you that "You can do better" along with all the problems that came with missing so much school, which leads to you almost constantly failing at things, you start to see ***yourself*** as the problem, not the institution. There is a lot of [serious trauma](https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/complex-ptsd) because this. As you can imagine, all of this has affected me seriously. I enjoy doing Maths, Programming and lots of other things, but I don't enjoy them as much anymore because it just reminds me of the past. You know that feeling like "I need to take out the rubbish but I just can't be bothered"? That's how I feel about the things I used to enjoy. While I am recovering from this, it's a really slow journey which I haven't finished yet.

## My history with bullying
Around the same time I was living with the aforementioned abusive person, I was also being bullied at school, as Autistic kids usually are. Looking back on this the absolute worst thing was my attitude toward it. Given the circumstances I was in I simply accepted it and told myself "I deserve this". As is obvious this did not help me in the long run. Luckily though this was the only time I was ever really consistently bullied, though there were a few more short lived ones as the years went on.

# Now that we're finished with the bad stuff Why does this exist?
While the above might suggest this is a cry of help of sorts, **it is not**. I have a lot of trouble expressing myself to other people, so I figured I would make a website to express who I am, what I'm interested in and the Ideas I have. This is simply a way to express myself, that is all there is to it.

# To finish off, here's a picture of my cat. His name is Jamie and he screams a lot. If you're sad from reading all that hopefully this will cheer you up
