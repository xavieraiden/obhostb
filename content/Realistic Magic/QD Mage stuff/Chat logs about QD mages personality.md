**Chris_42 [11:03 PM]**:  
Hey folks, anyone up?

**TayTay_1337 [11:04 PM]**:  
Yo, what's the deal?

**Jordy$Geek [11:04 PM]**:  
Hey, hey, what's the scoop?

**Chris_42 [11:05 PM]**:  
So, been shadowin' some QD Mages for my thesis, ya know? They're... idk, just weird, man.

**TayTay_1337 [11:06 PM]**:  
Weird how? Spill.

**Jordy$Geek [11:07 PM]**:  
Yeah, man, spill. What's up?

**Chris_42 [11:08 PM]**:  
It's like they're here but not? Like they're juggling two things at once, but you can't see the second thing they're juggling. Freaky stuff.

**Alex_Wiz21 [11:09 PM]**:  
Just popped in. QD Mages? Lol, they're like a puzzle no one can solve.

**Chris_42 [11:10 PM]**:  
You have no idea, Alex. But what's the lowdown?

**TayTay_1337 [11:11 PM]**:  
Zoned out or what?

**Jordy$Geek [11:12 PM]**:  
BRB, gotta piss.

**Chris_42 [11:13 PM]**:  
Nah, not zoned out. It's more like they're doing something else while they're standing there, but you can't see what that something else is. Also, anyone catch the game last night?

**Alex_Wiz21 [11:14 PM]**:  
I get you. It's like they're here but also checked out. And yeah, that game was insane!

**TayTay_1337 [11:15 PM]**:  
That's nuts. Like they're tapped into something else? And nah, missed the game.

**Chris_42 [11:16 PM]**:  
Yeah, and sometimes they'll glance at a spot right before something happens. No one talks about it, can't find shit online.

**Jordy$Geek [11:17 PM]**:  
WTF, just got back and read that. That's some Twilight Zone shit. Also, who won the game?

**Alex_Wiz21 [11:18 PM]**:  
Damn, that's a mind-bender. And yeah, our team won, Jordy!

**TayTay_1337 [11:19 PM]**:  
Wait, wait, wait. So you're saying they kinda... sense stuff before it happens? That's not just coincidence?

**Chris_42 [11:20 PM]**:  
I mean, could be? But it's happened enough times to make me wonder, ya know?

**Jordy$Geek [11:21 PM]**:  
For real, don't leave us in the dark! And nice, gotta catch the highlights. But back to the QD Mages, that's like some low-key psychic stuff, isn't it?

**Alex_Wiz21 [11:22 PM]**:  
Man, now I'm curious too. If you find out anything, you better share. And yeah, low-key psychic sounds about right, but who knows?

**Chris_42 [11:23 PM]**:  
Will do, guys. I'm just as intrigued as you are. Gonna dig deeper into this.

**TayTay_1337 [11:24 PM]**:  
Yeah, don't hog all the good stuff! And Chris, if you find out they're actually psychic, I'm gonna lose it, lol.
