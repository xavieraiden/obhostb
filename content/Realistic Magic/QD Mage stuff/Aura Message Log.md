**Chris_42 [12:01 AM]**:  
Hey, y'all still up?

**TayTay_1337 [12:02 AM]**:  
Yeah, what's up?

**Jordy$Geek [12:02 AM]**:  
Still here, man. What's on your mind?

**Alex_Wiz21 [12:03 AM]**:  
Yo, yo, yo. What's the late-night topic?

**Chris_42 [12:04 AM]**:  
So, you guys ever get close to a QD Mage? Their aura is something else.

**TayTay_1337 [12:05 AM]**:  
Oh man, don't even get me started. It's like stepping into a fridge.

**Jordy$Geek [12:06 AM]**:  
For real, it's like they're walking AC units or something. And it's dark, like, emotionally dark.

**Alex_Wiz21 [12:07 AM]**:  
Yeah, it's like they're radiating this cold, dark vibe. Super weird but kinda cool?

**Chris_42 [12:08 AM]**:  
Exactly! I mean, I get it's the quantum dots absorbing energy and all, but it's still freaky to experience.

**TayTay_1337 [12:09 AM]**:  
Right? Like, I know the science behind it, but it doesn't make it any less bizarre.

**Jordy$Geek [12:10 AM]**:  
BRB, snack time.

**Alex_Wiz21 [12:11 AM]**:  
It's one of those things where understanding the 'why' doesn't make the 'what' any less strange.

**Chris_42 [12:12 AM]**:  
Totally. And have you noticed how it's not just temperature? It's like the air gets thicker or something.

**Jordy$Geek [12:13 AM]**:  
Back. And yeah, it's like you're walking through molasses or something. The air feels heavy.

**TayTay_1337 [12:14 AM]**:  
Yeah, it's like the atmosphere changes. You can feel it in your bones, man.

**Alex_Wiz21 [12:15 AM]**:  
For sure. It's like their aura has its own gravity or something. Pulls you in but also kinda pushes you away?

**Chris_42 [12:16 AM]**:  
Exactly, it's like you're both attracted and repelled at the same time. Super conflicting feelings.

**Jordy$Geek [12:17 AM]**:  
It's like they're their own little universe. You get close, and you're in their world, whether you like it or not.

**TayTay_1337 [12:18 AM]**:  
Couldn't have said it better. It's like they're a walking paradox.

**Chris_42 [12:19 AM]**:  
Yeah, it's wild. Makes you wonder what else we don't know about them, even if we think we understand the basics.

**Alex_Wiz21 [12:20 AM]**:  
For real. They're like the ultimate mystery, even when you think you've figured them out.
