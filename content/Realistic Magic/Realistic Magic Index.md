This magic system is based upon the manipulation of real scientific principles, some people in this world are born "Magically Gifted" with the ability to perceive and to a small extent manipulate [Electromagnetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism) phenomena (Light, Magnetic Fields, Electricity, Charged Particles ETC). Magically gifted individuals in this world might take lessons, or attend a magic university of sorts and specialise into further fields, Listed below are the different fields.

# As of now only one has been written.

[[Quantum Dot Mages]] specialize in the manipulation of Quantum Dots, as the title suggests.



# Some ideas I'm throwing around (or have abandoned I don't know, probably both)

### Light Speed Modification Mage (LSM Mage) (Abandoned)
The idea for this was "What if you could change the universal constant of the speed of light in a given region of space?" but it doesn't quite live up to the [[Quantum Dot Mages|QD Mage]], and I don't want a massive variance in quality between them. I want them all to be super unique, interesting and cool, but the LSM mage doesn't quite manipulate a cool ***thing*** like the [[Quantum Dot Mages|QD Mage]] does so much as a concept. I want all of these to be based not just in real science, but ***real things that exist in real science.***

### Fundamental Force Manipulation Mage (FFM Mage) (Abandoned)
Stemming from the idea of "What if you could combine or separate the fundamental forces?" as well as my research into [The Electroweak Interaction,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction) I came to this idea, while it is really cool and unique yes, it just doesn't quite fit. Most other mages manipulate Electromagnetism specifically, and this feels a bit out of scope for what this magic system is.
