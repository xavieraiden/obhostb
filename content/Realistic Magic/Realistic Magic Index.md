# The index for my thoughts on realistic magic


###### I've always found it weird how in fiction, magic is always quite shallow. Someone would recite a spell and a fireball would appear. As of now I'm going to write down my thoughts on how magic would actually operate given real laws of physics.

In the future this will turn into my own magic system, but for the moment I am just writing about already prevalent magic in fiction.

| Magic Type/Element     | Details         |
| ---------------------- | --------------- |
| [[Fire Magic]]         |                 |
| [[Electrical Magic]]   | To Be Completed |
| [[Light Magic]]        | To Be Completed |
| [[Earth Magic ]]       | To Be Completed |
| [[Dark Magic]]         | To Be Completed |
| [[Life/Healing Magic]] | To Be Completed | 
|                        |                 |
