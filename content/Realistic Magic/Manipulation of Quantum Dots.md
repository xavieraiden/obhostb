## What Exactly Are [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)?

### The Basics of [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)

[quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) are nanometre-sized [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) particles that have unique [quantum mechanical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). They function as tiny "boxes" that can confine and manipulate [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) in specific, quantized energy levels. Due to their small size, they are subject to the principles of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).

### Interaction with Energy

[quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) can absorb various forms of energy, such as [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) or[thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy). When they absorb this energy, their electrons move to higher energy levels. Eventually, these electrons return to their original states, releasing the stored energy, which can manifest as heat or light.

## [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) as Magical "Batteries"

### Ambient Recharging

In this context, [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) serve as a sort of "battery" that can absorb ambient heat from the environment. These dots would continuously recharge by drawing in thermal energy, storing it until it's time to release it.

## Cold Aura

Paradoxically, this leads to fire mages having a noticeably cold aura. The air around them would become cooler as the [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) draw in thermal energy from the environment.

### Power Scaling

The power of a user is directly correlated to the number of [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) they can control. The more [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) a user has at their disposal, the more potent their ability to release stored energy, as they have more energy to draw upon.

## Practical Implications

### Controlled Heat Generation

Specific manipulations of the energy levels within the [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) allow for control over the timing and amount of heat generated. This means varying amounts of energy can be released, either in a burst or as a sustained output.

### Directional Control

With precise control over the [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot), energy can be released in specific directions. This allows for targeted energy release, useful in various applications requiring precise control.

### Amplification

[quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) can also amplify existing sources of heat or energy. By directing the dots to absorb energy from an existing source, the stored energy can be released in a more intense burst, effectively amplifying the energy.


# Summary
In conclusion, we can see that a mage specialising in Quantum Dot Manipulation would be more of a heat mage than a fire mage. Though they could still set things on fire if they had a fuel source.
