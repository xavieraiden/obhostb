This is more of a scaffold, I will go more into depth in how Quantum Dots are used as well as some of the gadgetry that Quantum Dot Mages use.

## What Exactly Are [Quantum Dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)?

### The Fundamentals of [Quantum Dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot)

[Quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) are nanometre-sized [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) particles that exhibit unique [quantum mechanical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics). These particles serve as tiny "containers" that can confine and control [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) in specific, quantized energy states, thanks to the principles of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).

### Interaction with Energy

[Quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) can absorb various forms of energy, such as [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) or [thermal energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy). When they absorb this energy, their electrons transition to higher energy states. As these electrons revert to their original states, the stored energy is released either as photons (light) or as thermal energy (heat).

## [Quantum Dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) as Magical Capacitors

### Ambient Recharging

In this context, quantum dots function like capacitors that can absorb ambient energy, such as light or heat, from their surroundings. These dots continually recharge by drawing in this energy, storing it for future use.

### Dark and Cold Aura

Quantum Dot mages always have a dark and cold aura around them, a result of the constant absorption of light and thermal energy by the quantum dots they control.

### Energy Absorption Abilities

Quantum Dot mages can use the absorption properties of the dots to create unique effects:

- **Cold Zones**: By actively absorbing thermal energy from the surroundings, they can create areas of intense cold.
- **Walls of Darkness**: By absorbing photons, they can create a wall or zone of darkness, effectively blocking out light.

### Power Scaling

The potency of a mage is directly related to the number of [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) they can manipulate. The more quantum dots a mage controls, the greater their capacity to store and release energy.

## Practical Implications

### Controlled Energy Release

Mages can manipulate the energy levels within the [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) to control the timing and magnitude of energy release. This allows for the emission of varying amounts of light or heat, either in bursts or as a continuous output.

### Directional Control

With meticulous control over the [quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot), mages can direct the release of energy in specific directions. This is useful for applications requiring targeted energy release, such as illuminating a dark room or focusing heat on an object.

### Amplification

[Quantum dots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_dot) can also amplify existing sources of light or heat. By directing the dots to absorb energy from an existing source, the stored energy can be released in a more intense burst, effectively amplifying the energy.

# Summary

In conclusion, a mage specializing in Quantum Dot Manipulation would be a versatile energy mage, capable of manipulating both light and heat. Their abilities would extend beyond merely setting things on fire, offering a broader range of magical applications including the creation of cold zones and walls of darkness. The constant dark and cold aura surrounding these mages is a testament to their unique capabilities.

- NOTE: This is an artistic representation, this does not actually show what a realistic combat stance might look like as an entirely black and white canvas doesn't look good. In reality a QD Mage would completely obscure their opponents' vision.
