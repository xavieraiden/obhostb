# General outline
Fire magic in fiction is always quite similar. Someone chants a spell or channels magic and fire appears. In some fiction it can be controlled though.

# But first, what really *IS* fire?

### How do you make fire?
A fire requires 3 things, a [Fuel Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel), an [Oxidizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidizing_agent) and an Ignition source. In technical terms a fire is an [Exothermic Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_reaction) through the means of rapid [oxidization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox) of the fuel source, which produces heat and waste products.
### But why is fire bright?
Contrary to popular belief, in most fires the bright orange glow you get is actually due to the [Incandescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescence) of the soot particles that the fire produces, this is why a [Methanol Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmEsU-QYxNk) is invisible in the daytime, it does not produce any soot upon [Combustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion) which leads to the flame being incredibly dim.

# Creation of Fire
So how do they make the fire? There are several methods through which the creation of the flame could happen.

### Fuel source
In this case we can assume that either A. a fuel source is being materialized and then ignited. 
Or B. the "Magician" or "Wizard" has an extra organ (perhaps in the fingertip?) which creates, expels and then ignites the fuel source (through a spark maybe?).


### Atmospheric [Ionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization) 
Whilst not technically a flame due to there being no [Combustion Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion), It is fairly close to what we want because (especially hot) fire is also technically a [Plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)). So you can think of Plasma as just extremely hot fire. The actual ionization process could be done through several means.
- An Ultra strong magnetic field could theoretically just excite the atoms enough to turn them into a plasma, alternatively the magnetic field might just rip the electrons out of orbit. It is important to mention though that the strength of magnetic field required to do this is so extreme that modern physics struggles to describe magnetics fields of this intensity
- Through the generation of large voltages a mage could ionize the particles in the atmosphere, creating plasma. Though, again. Plasma is not necessarily the same as fire.
